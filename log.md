# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've done the first level of [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1) with extra star.

**Thoughts** [Vlada](https://twitter.com/two_in_one) invites me to join that challenge. I never thought that taking a part in a challenge will be so excited.

### Day 2: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've done 2 level of [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2).

**Thoughts** You will be disappointed, if you think that you predicted the text of the extra task. Sometimes it makes you to rewrite a part of your previous solution.
